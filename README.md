# goCamelCase

Problem Statement:
Write a RESTFul endpoint in GOLang that would take a string as an input and return camelCase of the same based on English dictionary words.
You should use a dictionary API (for example free API of https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/). 

For example:

input: "onetwothree"

output: "oneTwoThree" 

The service code should be deployed in Azure.
